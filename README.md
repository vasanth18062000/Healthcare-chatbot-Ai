  (our chatbot can do both voice to text and text to voice specifications)

This paper aims to demonstrate the promotion of chatbots in the medical sector for 
curing infectious diseases. The methodology involves creating awareness among users and 
providing proper medical solutions to prevent diseases. A preliminary training model and a 
study report were developed to enhance human interaction in databases using natural language 
processing to describe human behaviours and chatbot characteristics. An AI Chatbot 
interaction and prediction model was proposed using a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron. 
Our analysis revealed a gap in knowledge regarding theoretical guidelines and practical 
recommendations for creating AI chatbots for lifestyle improvement programs. The proposed 
model's time complexity and accuracy of testing were compared. The study also explores the 
functionalities and possible applications of medical chatbots and the challenges they pose 
during health crises, mainly pandemics. Our findings will aid researchers in understanding 
these revolutionary technologies' layout and applications, required for continuous improvement 
in medical chatbot functionality, which will be beneficial in avoiding COVID-19. Therefore, 
we conclude that chatbots can play a crucial role in the medical sector by promoting awareness 
and providing solutions to prevent infectious diseases.


          !!!Just import the file in vs code application, then run main.py, and finally run gui.py!!!
